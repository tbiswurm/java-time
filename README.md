:coffee:  Java Time!  :tada:
=================================================

Welcome to _Java Time!_ In this repository, I build mini-projects to refresh and improve my Java skills.

Feel free to nose around! To make things easier, a little directory: 

### [JavaMarket](./java-market)
An object-oriented program simulating a typical supermarket.

### [Codewars Solutions](./codewars-solutions)
A collection of Java solutions to problems ("kata") I've solved on the popular coding platform [Codewars](http://codewars.com).

### [Code Sandbox](./code-sandbox)
A sandbox for me to noodle around in Java. Beware: it's messy!
