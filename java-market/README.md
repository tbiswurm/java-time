=================================================

\*_Beep boop_\*, welcome to _JavaMarket_!

For now, rough technical information is hosted [here](./technical-notes.md).

 

Introduction
------------
_JavaMarket_ is a CLI program that lets users simulate the function of a typical grocery store.

Users may choose to run the program in one of two modes:
* **Sandbox**, where they can play around with the program's basic features in a free-form environment; and
* **Play**, where they play a turn-based game as a store manager trying to optimize their store's operations as waves of
    customers arrive.

<!-- 
The [Introduction](#introduction) section &ndash; which you are presently reading &ndash; should provide background for your software project, a brief explanation of what the project is about, and optionally, pointers to resources that can help orient readers.  (Some README recommendations go straight to installation instructions as the first section, but in my opinion, introductions are important for readers who are not familiar with your technical area.)  Ideally, this section should be short.
-->

Features
------------
JavaMarket implements a highly simplified model of real-world grocery stores. At this point, it supports the following
high-level features:
* **Store staff.** Users can hire shelf stockers with a limited number of items they can stock per day and a wage.
* **Floor-plan organization.** Departments, aisles, and shelves.
* **Shopping lists**
* **Expiry dates**
* **Budget management**



Installation
------------

// TODO
<!--
Begin this section by mentioning any prerequisites that may be important for users to have before they can use your software.  Examples include hardware and operating system requirements.

Next, provide step-by-step instructions for installing the software, preferably with command examples that can be copy-pasted by readers into their software environments. For example:

```bash
a command-line command here
```

Sometimes, subsections may be needed for different operating systems or particularly complicated installations.

Usage
-----

To run the program:
```bash
./gradlew run
```
<!-- 
explain more about how to run the software, what kind of output or behavior to expect, and so on.
